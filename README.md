<b>Snake in Python</b>

Snake made on python using pygame

<b>Usage</b>
<ul>
  <li>Spacebar to pause</li>
  <li>WASD to move</li>
  <li>Game gets progressively faster the bigger the snake gets</li>

<b>Missing features</b>
<ul>
  <li>Score</li>
  <li>Snake moves unlike a snake (can move diagonally)(?)</li>
  <li>The game itself may feel choppy at the beginning</li>

This took me around a day to make. <i>Pygame</i> is fun
