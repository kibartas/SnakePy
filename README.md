<b>Snake in Python</b>

Snake made in python using pygame

<b>Usage</b>
<ul>
  <li>Spacebar to pause</li>
  <li>WASD to move</li>
  <li>Game gets progressively faster the bigger the snake gets</li>
</ul>

<b>Missing features</b>
<ul>
  <li><strike>Score</strike> (Update 07-12: Score has been added! Also added hiscore. Hiscores are saved in hiscores.txt file)</li>
  <li><strike>Snake moves unlike a snake (can move diagonally)(?)</strike> 
  (Update 07-12: The reason for this one is game ticks. If the player manages to press two movement buttons in the same tick the snake moves diagonally. I think I'll just leave this one be.)</li>
  <li>The game itself may feel choppy at the beginning (Update 07-01: Not sure if this is fixable)</li>
</ul>

This took me around a day to make. <i>Pygame</i> is fun
